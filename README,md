# ValueCog — MVP Valuation SaaS

Short checklist to get running locally:
- Option A (recommended with Docker): docker-compose up --build
- Option B (no Docker):
  - Start a Postgres DB and set DATABASE_URL in .env
  - Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm run dev
  - Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

What I produced (high-level)
- Backend: Node.js + Express, Knex migrations, valuation engine, JWT auth, PayPal + Paystack sandbox flows, PDF generation (Puppeteer), S3-compatible or local storage
- Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind minimal UI for signup/login, valuation wizard, results, admin stubs
- Dockerfiles and docker-compose (Postgres + backend + frontend)
- Tests: Jest tests for valuation engine
- CI: GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and build
- Postman/curl happy path examples and README instructions for PayPal/Paystack sandbox and ngrok

Main local run steps (Docker)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at repo root and replace placeholders.
2. docker-compose up --build
3. Wait for services to start, then open http://localhost:5173 (frontend).

Main local run steps (no Docker)
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both backend and frontend as needed.
2. Start Postgres and set DATABASE_URL in backend/.env.
3. Backend: cd backend && npm install && npm run migrate && npm run seed && npm run dev
4. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev

High-level architecture
- Frontend (React + Vite) communicates with Backend (Express) over REST JSON.
- Backend uses Knex to talk to Postgres (or SQLite for dev as a fallback).
- PDF generation via Puppeteer: server generates an HTML report and creates a PDF, stores to disk or S3-compatible storage.
- Payment flows: PayPal Checkout v2 and Paystack sandbox. Both have create-order endpoints and webhook endpoints to verify and unlock reports.

Security notes
- All secrets come from environment variables.
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt.
- JWT issued to logged-in users; refresh tokens not implemented in this MVP but JWT expiry is enforced.
- Rate limiting middleware is included (express-rate-limit).
